1. A day of day flies

James: I just can't believe this shit!

Mark: What' up, bro?

James: I didn't know Michael was so full of shit! He tells fish stories all the time!
	He said his main squeeze was one of those Miss Korea-wannabes, 
	but couldn't make it 'cause she had the runs on the day of the contest.
	And he said his old man is super-rich.... a chairman of Samsun or something.
	He's goona take over the company when his pop's gone.

Mark: No shit! Then why is he borrowing money all the time if he's got a loaded father?

James: That's exactly what I'm talking about, man!
	To him, everyday is April Fool's day.
	Can't believe that candy ass no more!

Mark: Easy, man. But after all, he is the one who's kind of pathetic, isn't he?
	He thinks he's born smart. Just leave hime alone.

James: I'm with you, dude. Anyway what time you're got them?

Mark: Oh, my god! It's already ten to midnight! We'd better hit the road now!

James: What're you talking about?! Night is still young!

Mark: C'mon! You had enough drinks already. Well, I'm buzzed.

James: But, I'm not! That was a drop in the bucket!
	Let's go for another round. It's on me.

Mark: No way! I don't drink like fish like you do!
	And, after all, those stuffs'll kill ya if you go overboard.

James: OK, forget it. Then how 'bout playing a pool?
	I can't just go home like this. It was a dog's day out today!

Mark: You touch ass! OK, let's go and see if I lost my touch!

James: You're the man!

1. 하루살이들의 하루

James: 참. 어이가 없어서!

Mark: 무슨 일인데. 임마?

James: 마이클 새끼, 그렇게 야부리만 까고 돌아다니는 줄 몰랐지. 
	매일 허풍만 떨고 돌아다는데, 뭐. 지 여자친구가 미스 코리아 지망생이었는데, 
	대회 당일에 마침 설사가 나서 떨어졌단다. 그리고 지 아버지가 재벌이라는데, 
	뭐 삼성 회장이라든가, 아버지가 돌아가시면 그 회사 지가 인수한단다.

Mark: 말도 안돼! 그런 자식이 왜 매일 돈이나 꾸고 돌아다니는거야. 아버지가 그렇게 갑부면?

James: 내 말이 그말이야!
	1년 365일이 다 만우절인 줄 아나봐. 그 새끼 더 이상 믿지를 못하겠어!

Mark: 진정해라. 임마. 사실 불쌍한 건 그 자식이지. 안 그래?
	그렇게 잘나게 태어난 줄로 아는데, 그냥 내버려 두자!

James: 니 말이 맞아. 그나저나 지금 몇 시냐?

Mark: 와. 이런! 벌써 밤 12시 10분 전이야! 슬슬 일어나야 되겠다.

James: 무슨 소리야? 아직 초저녁인데?!

Mark: 야. 제발! 마실 만큼 마셨잖아. 난 취했어.

James: 난 아직 멀었어. 간에 기별도 안 가!
야 2차 가자! 내가 낼께.

Mark: 됐어! 난 너처럼 그렇게 무식하게 술 안 먹어.
	그리고 그렇게 무지막지하게 처먹으면 너 죽어. 임마!

James: 알았어, 알았어. 그럼 당구 한판은 어때?
	이렇게 그냥 집에 갈 수는 없어. 오늘 하루종일 뻥이나 깠단 말이야!

Mark: 끈질긴 놈! 그래. 가서 어디 내 실력이 아직 살아 있나 보자.

James: 그래야지, 자식!

2. Mission Totally Impossible

President: (over inter phone) Mr. Kim.
	Come to my office, ASAP!

Mr. Kim: I'm on my way, sir.
	(Mr. Kim steps into the office)

President: What the fuck is going around here in this company?

Mr. Kim: What do you mean, sir?

President: What do I mean? You still don't get it, do you?
	I'm talking about our Project A! The one we've been preparing for years!
	Apparrently it's in the possession of Smith & Co!

Mr. Kim: It can't be...! Only Mr. Lee and I have access to the files!! You know that!

President: We've been back-stabbed! There is a rumor 
	Mr. Lee might've handed over the classified files to them.
	And of course he's been offered a manager position there.

Mr. Kim: Damm it! I knew it'd happen someday!
	He was already caught stealing our files red-handed once two years ago!
	I should've beat the living crab out of him and kicked him out of here at the first place!
	Let me go and see what's going on, sir.

President: It's too late! He already beat the rap.
	Just try to find his whereabouts!

Mr. Kim: Right away, sir.
	And if he's really double-crossed, he's dead meat!

President: I don't care whatever you do and whatever it might take!
	I'll give you ONE day! Bring that son of a bitch to my desk dead or alive!
	And keep this matter under wraps! It's a matter of life and death to our company.
	Nothing should go wrong.
	Show him nobody can never ever be better off betraying his own people!

3. Fat Man Walking

Jenny: What's the date today? (Sneeze)

Mark: Bless you! It's June 2nd. Why?

Jenny: The job interview is just around the corner?
	I'd better get started to prepare for that shit!

Mark: Where're you applying to?

Jenny: To Korean Air Lines.
	I'm applying for new fight attendants recruitment.

Mark: I'm sorry to tell you this, miss. But look at you! You're got both beer belly and pot belly!
	You look like a hippo or a pumpkin pie or something. Flight attendants? Just forget it!

Jenny: What did you just call me? A hippo?

Mark: Nope. A pumpkin pie, I said. But what's true is true.
	If you really wanna make it as a flight attendant, you ought to bite the bullet and be on a hard-core diet.
	A cup of milk is more than enough to keep you alive for a day. Just take my advice and do it!

Jenny: A cup of milk? You crazy! I can't skip even a meal. If I do, I'm dead.
	I gotta have what I gotta have.
	That's not to be compromised!
