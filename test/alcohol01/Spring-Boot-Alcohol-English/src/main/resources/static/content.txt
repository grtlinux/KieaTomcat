1. A day of day flies

James: I just can't believe this shit!

Mark: What' up, bro?

James: I didn't know Michael was so full of shit! He tells fish stories all the time!
	He said his main squeeze was one of those Miss Korea-wannabes, 
	but couldn't make it 'cause she had the runs on the day of the contest.
	And he said his old man is super-rich.... a chairman of Samsun or something.
	He's goona take over the company when his pop's gone.

Mark: No shit! Then why is he borrowing money all the time if he's got a loaded father?

James: That's exactly what I'm talking about, man!
	To him, everyday is April Fool's day.
	Can't believe that candy ass no more!

Mark: Easy, man. But after all, he is the one who's kind of pathetic, isn't he?
	He thinks he's born smart. Just leave hime alone.

James: I'm with you, dude. Anyway what time you're got them?

Mark: Oh, my god! It's already ten to midnight! We'd better hit the road now!

James: What're you talking about?! Night is still young!

Mark: C'mon! You had enough drinks already. Well, I'm buzzed.

James: But, I'm not! That was a drop in the bucket!
	Let's go for another round. It's on me.

Mark: No way! I don't drink like fish like you do!
	And, after all, those stuffs'll kill ya if you go overboard.

James: OK, forget it. Then how 'bout playing a pool?
	I can't just go home like this. It was a dog's day out today!

Mark: You touch ass! OK, let's go and see if I lost my touch!

James: You're the man!

1. 하루살이들의 하루

James: 참. 어이가 없어서!

Mark: 무슨 일인데. 임마?

James: 마이클 새끼, 그렇게 야부리만 까고 돌아다니는 줄 몰랐지. 
	매일 허풍만 떨고 돌아다는데, 뭐. 지 여자친구가 미스 코리아 지망생이었는데, 
	대회 당일에 마침 설사가 나서 떨어졌단다. 그리고 지 아버지가 재벌이라는데, 
	뭐 삼성 회장이라든가, 아버지가 돌아가시면 그 회사 지가 인수한단다.

Mark: 말도 안돼! 그런 자식이 왜 매일 돈이나 꾸고 돌아다니는거야. 아버지가 그렇게 갑부면?

James: 내 말이 그말이야!
	1년 365일이 다 만우절인 줄 아나봐. 그 새끼 더 이상 믿지를 못하겠어!

Mark: 진정해라. 임마. 사실 불쌍한 건 그 자식이지. 안 그래?
	그렇게 잘나게 태어난 줄로 아는데, 그냥 내버려 두자!

James: 니 말이 맞아. 그나저나 지금 몇 시냐?

Mark: 와. 이런! 벌써 밤 12시 10분 전이야! 슬슬 일어나야 되겠다.

James: 무슨 소리야? 아직 초저녁인데?!

Mark: 야. 제발! 마실 만큼 마셨잖아. 난 취했어.

James: 난 아직 멀었어. 간에 기별도 안 가!
야 2차 가자! 내가 낼께.

Mark: 됐어! 난 너처럼 그렇게 무식하게 술 안 먹어.
	그리고 그렇게 무지막지하게 처먹으면 너 죽어. 임마!

James: 알았어, 알았어. 그럼 당구 한판은 어때?
	이렇게 그냥 집에 갈 수는 없어. 오늘 하루종일 뻥이나 깠단 말이야!

Mark: 끈질긴 놈! 그래. 가서 어디 내 실력이 아직 살아 있나 보자.

James: 그래야지, 자식!

2. Mission Totally Impossible

President: (over inter phone) Mr. Kim.
	Come to my office, ASAP!

Mr. Kim: I'm on my way, sir.
	(Mr. Kim steps into the office)

President: What the fuck is going around here in this company?

Mr. Kim: What do you mean, sir?

President: What do I mean? You still don't get it, do you?
	I'm talking about our Project A! The one we've been preparing for years!
	Apparrently it's in the possession of Smith & Co!

Mr. Kim: It can't be...! Only Mr. Lee and I have access to the files!! You know that!

President: We've been back-stabbed! There is a rumor 
	Mr. Lee might've handed over the classified files to them.
	And of course he's been offered a manager position there.

Mr. Kim: Damm it! I knew it'd happen someday!
	He was already caught stealing our files red-handed once two years ago!
	I should've beat the living crab out of him and kicked him out of here at the first place!
	Let me go and see what's going on, sir.

President: It's too late! He already beat the rap.
	Just try to find his whereabouts!

Mr. Kim: Right away, sir.
	And if he's really double-crossed, he's dead meat!

President: I don't care whatever you do and whatever it might take!
	I'll give you ONE day! Bring that son of a bitch to my desk dead or alive!
	And keep this matter under wraps! It's a matter of life and death to our company.
	Nothing should go wrong.
	Show him nobody can never ever be better off betraying his own people!

3. Fat Man Walking

Jenny: What's the date today? (Sneeze)

Mark: Bless you! It's June 2nd. Why?

Jenny: The job interview is just around the corner?
	I'd better get started to prepare for that shit!

Mark: Where're you applying to?

Jenny: To Korean Air Lines.
	I'm applying for new fight attendants recruitment.

Mark: I'm sorry to tell you this, miss. But look at you! You're got both beer belly and pot belly!
	You look like a hippo or a pumpkin pie or something. Flight attendants? Just forget it!

Jenny: What did you just call me? A hippo?

Mark: Nope. A pumpkin pie, I said. But what's true is true.
	If you really wanna make it as a flight attendant, you ought to bite the bullet and be on a hard-core diet.
	A cup of milk is more than enough to keep you alive for a day. Just take my advice and do it!

Jenny: A cup of milk? You crazy! I can't skip even a meal. If I do, I'm dead.
	I gotta have what I gotta have.
	That's not to be compromised!

Mark: I really have to give it to you! Oh, there comes James! James. Over here!

James: Hey! Long time no see, you guys!

Mark: Come sit. Have some drinks!

James: I need that. OK, bottoms up! (James finishes the drink.) By the way, James,
	you're gaining a little weight? Or are you pregnant?

Mark: Actually, we were talking about her weight. I told her she gotta be on a diet
	if she wanna he whatever she wanna be.

James: (laughing) A diet? Jenny being on a diet?!
	That's unimaginable! (to Jenny) Hey! Fat slob! Get real! You are so fat that you fall,
	you get stuck in the Grand Canyon!

Jenny: (standing up and slapping his face) You bastards! (She runs out)

Mark: Hey, Jenny! Wait up! What is wrong with you, James?! Are you drunk?
	Don't you know that kind of joke is death on people like Jenny? You such a brat!

James: I wasn't serious. I was just joking.

Mark: You really have to behave yourself sometimes, really! Can't you just stop being a bull in china shop? (He goes after Jenny)

James: What did I do wrong?!


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Once Upon A Time in Chinatown

Mark: James, let's take a break.

James: Sure.
	(They go out)

Mark: Can I bum a smoke? Oh, that too.
	Is that a diet Coke? Can I have a sip?

James: Just a sip.

Mark: Man, I'm so broke I ain't got no enough money even
	to buy a pack of cigarette these days.
	What day is today? Thursday? Friday?

James: You nut? It's Monday today. Remember yesterday
	was Sunday? I think you should go get your head examined.

Mark: Shut up! I'm perfectly fine!

James: Calm down. Can't you take a joke?

Mark: (sigh) Anyway, time is really dragging.
	I'm getting sick and tired of this button-down life.
	It just makes me so exhausted for nothing.

James: Button-down life? You?
	That's not what I'm hearing.

Mark: What do you mean?

James: Hey, I hear you're going out with a chink. What's up with that?

Mark: Oh, You're talking about Lucy. Yeah, I hooked her up at a club last weekend.
	Going out? Nope. Just flirting around. But she's a killer, man!
	She's a carbon copy of Joan Chang.

James: You said you're damn broke. How did you hook up a babe like that them?
	You know what they say, "No money. No honey".

Mark: You know Andy's on his business trip to Japan and won't be back for a while.
	So, I borrowed Andy's Porsche last weekend. And it worked!
	No wonder they say Porsche is a chick magnet!

James: You'd better be very careful. You make a scratch on that wheel,
	I bet Andy's gonna personally kill you. By the way, can I crash at your place tonight?

Mark: Sure, but I can't wake you up in the morning.

5. Norte! Norte! - 1

Owner: James, go make copies of this CD.

James: What's this?

Owner: It's a hot item, a new computer program.
	I've got a hunch we can make a fortune out of this in the black market.

James: Another illegal duplication?
	Sir, I was hired as a computer programmer not as some kind of copy cat.

Owner: Are you out of your mind?
	It costs an arm and a leg to purchase legit products. You know that!
	Customers out there want afforadable products and we supply'em.
	I don't see nothing wrong with that.

James: That's still against law. Korea is known as "copyright twilight zone".
	And you're the one who's responsible for. You ought to be ashamed.

Owner: You sometimes get so stupid! Be street-smart, you college boy!
	It's all about money! Money is what drives this world.
	And we gotta do whatever it takes if it's about money.

James: Anyway, I can't do this shit no more.

Owner: I know you have a family to feed, James.
	Ain't you gonna be sorry if they're gonna be starved 'cause all of you?
	You're still wet behind ears!

James: Maybe you're right. I'm still too young to understand the harsh world.
	But there is one thing I'm sure. That's you're nothing but a con man!

Owner: That's it! You're fired!

James: You know what. I don't give a shit about it!
	You wanna fire me? Well, go ahead! Just find a good Lawyer!
	(Owner is stunned)
	
Owner: A lawyer? You don't have guts to sue me!

James: Well, try me!

Owner: If you sue me, I'll hand you over to INS right away!
	You wet back-illegal resident!

James: Come hell or high water!

6. Beverly Hills flirts!

Mark: Wow! What do we have here!
	James, what's the occasion today?
	You dressed up and got a haircut! You look totally different!

James: You bet I do. Tonight is the night!

Mark: What night? What're you talking about?

James: Guess who I'm gonna have a date with tonight!

Mark: How should I know? Jenny? Angela? Woofy?

James: Nope. Don't you ever be surprised!
	I'm having a date with Sharon Stone!

Mark: You mean Sharon Stone, Sharon Stone? The actress Sharon Stone?

James: That's the one I'm talking about, man!

Mark: Shut up! You're just cranking it out of your pure ass!

James: I'm dead serious! I can bet my house on it!

Mark: Why would the famous actresses like her like to go out with you?

James: You know cruising for babes is my middle name right?
	I met the girl at a gym in Beverly Hills and we happened to start conversation.
	I told her I was a big-time businessman is East Asia
	and came to Hollywood for some movie investments.
	And there she goes. She asked me out.

Mark: If that crap is true, you surly know how to treat women.

James: It's all about Dead Presidents, my friend.
	If you're loaded, they go after you.

Mark: Ditto! You're absolutely right!
	So, Where're you taking her tonight?

James: There's a new jazz club just opened up on Melrose.
	I'm thinking I might check out the place tonight.

Mark: It occurred to me, your car is in body shop now, right?
	If you need a ride, I'm here, man.

James: I'd rather walk than ride your cheap Honda Civic!

Mark: Better than nothing.




-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7.Que Sera Sera!

Father: So have you decided yet?

James: Decided what yet?

Father: Your graduate school!

James: Oh, dad! I thought that conversation was over!

Father: Listen to me, son. Now that you're a senior, it's time to think about MBA.

James: Do I have to get an MBA to get a better job. pop?

Father: Does a bear shit in the woods? Of course! With an MBA, sky is no limit these days!

James: Man! But you know how boring the business schools are!
	Professors are all nerdy, tuition is way too expensive, and classes are dull!
	And most of all, I don't wanna spend months to study for GMAT.

Father: It's all for your own sake! Just do it as I say!

James: Don't expect too much of me, pop! You know me better than I do!
	MBA is too much for me! You're the one who's always calling me dummy.

Father: That's why I'm pushing you to an MBA, son!
	You gotta have degrees if you weren't born smart in this world!

James: BA degree is good enough already! See Bill Gates! He didn't even finish the college.

Father: But it was at least Harvard! And what are you?!
	You always drink like fish and get fucked up and make troubles all the time!
	And double whammy is you don't respect me as a father no more!

James: That's it. The conversation is over! I'm no going to MBA. Period.

Father: Do it or else!

James: What if I don't? What're you gonna do? Shoot me?
	I don't wanna take heat from you any more.

Father: Watch your language! I'm your father!
	I just want you to stop bumming around trying to run away from all your problems!

8. When James meets Mimi

James: Hi. I'm James.

Mimi: Mimi, here. Pleasure to meet you.

James: Pleasure is all mine. Why don't we start dinner first?
	What would you like?

Mimi: I'm afraid I lost my appetite. Actually, I had something before I came here.

James: It's none of my business. But, eating between meals doesn't do any goog to your health.
	No offense, of course. Then why don't we just have a bottle of wine?

Mimi: I heard you work in a law firm. How do you like your work?

James: Nothing special about it, you know. To lawyers, everyday is one of those days.
	Do you come out on a blind date often?

Mimi: Well, actually it's my second time. I went on my first date when I was a sophomore.
	But the guy had a face that could stop the clock! I was so embarrassed I said to myself,
	"I would never have a blind date again!" But Jenny kept telling me about you day after day,
	that you're so cute and capable, if she wasn't married, she'd go after you and stuff.
	So here I am. Came to check you out.

James: I'm so flattered. So what do you do, Mimi?

Mimi: Well, I work in a hotel casino. I'm a dealer.
	But I think I'm gonna quite soon 'cause I have some troubles with my supervisior.
	I saw her one day smoking pot in the locker and she said,
	I tell anyone about that, I'm fired

James: Well, everyone has a skeleton in his closet.

Mimi: And she has one of those weird habits, a peeping Tom and stuff.
	Enough is enough. I can't take that shit no more.

James: I know how you feel. Actually, I'm quitting myself too.
	I used to be known as a rainmaker. But I somehow lost a big case last month,
	which I was certain to be on my side. But that wasn't my fault!

Mimi: Well, your partners don't seem to understand what they say, "even Homer sometimes nods".
	Go tell'em "Hey, assholes! Fat lady sang a song! This firm is over without me!"

James: Thanks. I like the way you talk. Changing the subject, you like sports?

Mimi: Oh, yeah. I go skydiving every weekend!

James: That's one of those extreme sports!

Mimi: You bet it is! People sometimes get killed doing that kind of stuff.



-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9. I left my heart in San Francisco

James: When was the last time we went out for a driving?

Mark: It's been a while, I guess?

James: Look at the beautiful coast of Malibu!
	It always makes me feel like pigs in shit driving down this Pacific Coast Highway
	with a top down under the beautiful sun of Southern California!

Mark: I couldn't agree with you more!

James: Yeah. There is the famous 'Moon shadow'.
	Whenever I pass by here, I think of Jenny.
	Because that's the place where I met Jenny for the first time.

Mark: Hey, cut it out! Let's not talk about your bitch for a while.
	Let's just spend some quality time together.
	Just you and me! OK?

James: You're just jealous.

Mark: What the heck! While we're here, why don't we go all the way up to San Francisco Bay!
	Wee can spend the night there and head back tomorrow morning!
	What do you say?

James: Well, I don't know. I might be gonna have to see Jenny tonight.

Mark: Don't be a spoil sport, man!
	Aren't you just getting fed up with those pathetic "love me, love me not" stuffs?
	Come on, man! I'm begging you like this, Please?

James: I've stood her up several times already.
	If I do again this time, she's definitely gonna think I'm a fly-by-night.

Mark: If she ever does that, don't you worry, I'll hook you up with my sister myself!
	You know she's been selected as a cover girl for 'Sport Illustrated' this month.

James: You sure?

Mark: Needs you ask?

James: OK! Fuck it! Just floor it! Let's wear some flowers on our hats!




-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10. University of Spoiled Child

James: Hey, FOB! Freeze! Where're you headed so fast?

Mark: I'm tailing somebody.

James: Tailing who? (looking around)

Mark: You see the babe walking over there?
	She's in the same class with me this semester, and I think I got a crush on her.

James: Oh, man. You have such a weird taste!
	That chubby girl with a big head is your type?!

Mark: You don't understand. Beauty is only skin-deep!
	What's important is inside your heart.

James: You gotta be damn serious!
	I don't get it. What happened to you?
	You were the one always saying, "all ugly bitches should go to hell!"

Mark: I happened to spill a hot soup on her lap by accident in the cafeteria the other day.
	I thought she'd be quite pissed. But actually she wasn't.
	She showed me a smile and said, it's perfectly all right. And then I got a crush.

James: You stupid retard! That's not that she's got a pure heart, but she's just fucking stupid!

Mark: If you ever use a four-letter-word again, I swear to God, I'll kill you!

James: Wooo! I'm scared! So what're you gonna do? Just keep on tailing her?

Mark: I'm goona break the ice with her and ask her out tonight.

James: But, you don't know nothing about her, do you?

Mark: I know one thing for sure. She's getting A's all the time in the class!

James: Get real, my friend.
	Smart girls like her ain't fond of party animals like you getting blacked out all the time, 
	ditching classes all the time.

Mark: You think so? You wanna bet?






-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11. C.H.P

CHP: Get off the freeway and pull over your car!

James: Fuck! We're in deep shit! They've got us!

Mark: Who gives a shit! Just stop on it!

James: You've got shit-faced already! Just shut up and stay still!

Mark: Hey! Chew this match! You won't smell alcohol!

CHP: (to James) Can I see your license and registration, please?
	You were going 100 miles on 65 mile zone.

James: I'm sorry. Can you just let it slide this time?

CHP: What do you think? Just step out of your vehicle.
	Let's do some sobriety tests.

James: (stunned) I'm sober, sir! I don't drink!

CHP: That we have to find out. Let's go, pal!
	(He suddenly runs for his life)

CHP1: (to CHP2) Get him!

CHP2: Freeze! You motherfucker! Or Shoot you down!
	(CHP2 goes after James and beats him down)

James: (crying) Let me go! Let me go!

CHP2: (to CHP1) I got him! I got it under control!

Mark: (crying) The guy over there. His family's gone belly up and ain't got no place to lean on!
	And worst of all, he's even got dumped by his girl!
	So he had a drink 'cause he's sad, he's hurt!
	
CHP1: Hey, get lost! Stay away! Or I'll book you too!

Mark: Have a heart, sir!

CHP2: Hey, stop getting into the way!

CHP1: (looking at the license plate cover of the car) You guys Trojans?

James: Yes. We go to USC.

CHP1: So did I. People like you guys're giving a bad name to all Trojan alumni!

CHP2: Where did you guys have a drink?

Mark: Well, we went here and there doing this and that all day long,
	So, can't clearly remember where and how much we drank.

CHP1: You guys are under arrest for DUI! Cuff him!

12. Norte! Norte!

Julio: You look so trashed! What's up, amigo?

Jose: I was quite fucked up last night. Had too much drink.

Julio: You went out again? Where did you go this time?

Jose: "Los Tunas"

Julio: Oh, your hangout place on Western Ave.

Jose: Hold on a sec. I gotta go puke.

Julio: Gross, man! You spoiled my favorite rug!
	It's the hand-me-down from my father!!

Jose: Sorry, but I'm having a terrible hangover!

Julio: You want me to get some hangover chaser?

Jose: Thanks, but no thanks. I can hang on.

Julio: By the way, why did you have so much drink?
	Something's up?

Jose: I got the pink slip yesterday.

Julio: Hold Santa Maria! That bleeping Korean tightwad fired you?
	What did you do wrong?

Jose: I had a fight with that motherfucker. I asked him for a raise last night saying
	I couldn't feed my family no more with that minimum pay of $4.25 per hour!
	But he called me a wet-back and fired me. I couldn't stand that.

Julio: You did the right thing, esse!
	Those god damn Koreans are same as Gringos!
	Only thing they know and care is money, man.

Jose: You can say that again. But, I have no idea what to do from now on!
	You know how this band-to-mouth life is like.
	I don't work today, my family go to sleep starving.

Julio: I think it's time to get a Green Card, esse. That's the only way out!

Jose: We're illegal residents. How can we possibley get a Green Card?

Julio: I hear if we grease palms of INS officers and marry any citizens just on paper,
	then there we have our own Green Cards!

Jose: Marry another woman? Then what about my wife now?

Julio: Don't worry. As soon as you get the card, you can go to Reno.




-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
13. L.A story

James: Hey, Mark. Where're you going?

Mark: I'm on my way to school. How about you?

James: I'm going the same direction. I'll give you a ride. Hop in!
	(They head to school)

James: It's been over ten years since I came here to LA for study.

Mark: So, are you homesick? Is that what you're saying?

James: Nope. I don't miss my hometown in Ohio any more.
	Los Angeles's become my home away from home.

Mark: So when're you finishing your doctor's degree?
	It's already your sixth semester, right?

James: Actually, it's really kiling me.
	My dissertation is due coming July but I haven't even decided the subject yet!
	I've had my nose buried in book for weeks in the library.
	But that doesn't help at all. I'm stuck, man.

Mark: What happened to you? You never used to be like this.

James: I guess I've become a has-been now.

Mark: Probably. Why don't you request your professor to delay the due date a little?

James: Oh, I've already done that.
	But, you know what? He turned it down. He's a damn racist.
	I know he hates Asian immigrants students like me.

Mark: Can't be! You're just overreacting!
	I think you just got a little hang-up as a minority student.

James: No! Trust me! Everyone knows he's discriminating minorities and women in selecting his TAs.
	He really doesn't live up to his name!
	And he's quote-unquote college professor and he's even got his Ph.D. from Harvard!
	Shame on him!

Mark: Just hang in there. You're almost home.
	Doctor's degree in political science is not that easy to come by.

James: I guess you're right.
	Where do you want me to drop you?

Mark: Oh, just drop me here.

James: OK, Hasta La Vista, baby!



-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
14. That's what friends are for!

(On the street. James bumps into Mark)

James: Do I know you? You look familiar.

Mark: I guess so, too. Where did you to go to college?

James: I went to Cal State LA. And you?

Mark: No wander! So did I! Now I remember.
	We took the same history class in freshman year, right?

James: That refreshes my memory!
	You're Mark, right? Mark Bennett! Long time, no see, Mark!

Mark: Hey, how've you been?

James: I've been great! How about you? What do you do these days?

Mark: Well, that's kind of rude question.
	But, I passed the bar exam and practice law now.

James: Yeah. It occurred to me, you were dying to become a lawyer then! Good for you, man!

Mark: You majored in business, I remember. What do you do?

James: I'm in between jobs and in between girls now.
	What a fucked up life it can possibly be!

Mark: Sorry to hear that.
	Anyway, I was on my way to meet some of my old classmates.
	You wanna join? I mean, if you're ever free, of course.

James: I told you I'm in between jobs! I'd love to go.

Mark: Let's go, then!

(Later, at the bar, James meets his old classmates)

Andy: James, I'm really crushed.
	Because I thought you were definitely going places.
	But you're just goofing off doing nothing now. What a shame!

(James stays silent)

Mark: Andy's got a point here, James.
	What happened to you? How come you didn't go to MBA?
	I thought you were going to MBA.

James: You guys are borrowing troubles.
	That's none of your business, I guess.
	I know what I'm doing, my friends!

Jeff: How about change of scenery, you guys?
	Atmosphere is going a bit awkward here!



-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
15. General Hospital.

James: Hey, Mark. You wanna go for a drink tonight?

Mark: Sorry. But I'm on the wagon.

James: Since when?

Mark: Since my doc said I've got diabetes.

James: You've got diabetes?! No kidding.
	You look you're in the pink now.

Mark: Apparently so, maybe. But the disease is eating my flesh from inside.
	I can't eat any thing with sugar and salt in it.

James: That's terrible, man!

Mark: Tell me about it! You know I hate people picky on food, right?
	But here I am. I've become the picky person myself.
	I'm going through a very critical moment.
	My doc said I ought to stop drinking for at least three years.
	So I want you to back me up.please.

James: Don't worry, pal. I'm right behind you.
	You need anything, you just let me know.

Mark: You're indeed the friend in need, James!
	I feel so good knowing I have a good friend like you!
	Let's go have a drink! It's on me!

James: Hey! You forget already? You're on the wagon!

Mark: Oh! That's right! Then, how about dinner together?
	I know a good Mediterranean cuisine restaurant on Sunset Strip.
	Can I use your cel phone for a sec? I'm gonna make table reservation.

James: Sure.

(James hands over his cel)

Mark: Il Ponario? I'd like a table for four at seven, please.

James: Four? We're got another company?

Mark: Just be patient, my friend!
	I'm gonna set you up with a girl tonight.

James: No way! I'm not having a blind date!
	Not tonight, at least.
	You know how picky on girls I am, Mark!

Mark: Take it from me. I can guarantee the quality.

James: We'll see.

16. There is no better tomorrow!

Jenny: Why are your eyes so swollen?

Mark: I couldn't sleep a wink last night.
	I had to stay up all night for something.

Jenny: It's the book thing again. right?
	Take some rest or this thing will get you sometime soon.
	You're pushing limits!

Mark: I can't. The publishing date's already been set for June 20th!
	And I have to do whatever I should to meet the deadline!
	Don't you ever think I'm doing this because the publisher told me so.
	I'm doing this because I care about my prospective readers!

Jenny: See! You are dozing even when you're talking to me now!

(Mark smashes his forehead on the desk)

Jenny: Mark! You OK?

Mark: Don't worry! I can live!

Jenny: But you're bleeding on your forehead!

Mark: Blood??

Jenny: Hang on. Let me wipe it out.

Mark: Just bear with me for a couple of days! Every dog has his day!
	When the book gets published and we see my first book displayed in bookstores,
	I'm sure we're gonna feel like a million!
	Fame and money are right ahead of us!

Jenny: Now that you're talking about fame and money,
	don't you think it's time for you to get a decent job now?
	You can't just spend the rest of your life just doing this and that.
	You need something stable and permanent.

Mark: So you're saying I should become one of those pathetic salaried workers, too,
	wearing a suit and tie all the time, punching in and out on time everyday?
	No fucking way! I like my life just the way it is!

Jenny: But people out there might think you as some kind of a black sheep.

Mark: I don't care what others think, Why should I?
	I am what I am and I do what I do.

Jenny: 

Mark: 

Jenny: 

Mark:

17. The Hero's way

Gang1: I got a hunch that cops might be lying in wait.

Gang2: You smell a rat or something?

Gang1: No, I mean, it's just my hunch. But be sure you're strapped.

Gang2: Done that shit already. I'm ready to kick some ass, man.

Gang1: Perfect. By the way, it's your first bank job, right? How're you feeling? Scared?

Gang2: You know, I'm cool, homeboy.
	After all, we gotta have this money to pay back the gambling debt, right?
	You never would have lost your shirt in horseracing if you ever listened to me just once!
	Anyway, it's not a child' play!

Gang1: Just chill out, man! I've been there before too.
	When I count three, we burst into that main gate, got it?

Gang2: Now? You fucking joking, right. We need more back-ups!

Gang1: I mean business. We, two, 're more than enough!
	And we haven't got all day. We need to hurry!

Gang2: I hope you know what you're doing now!

Gang1: One, two, three, Go!

(Gang1 & Gang2 burst into the bank)

Gang1: Everybody! Put your hands up in the air!
	Nobody moves! Nobody dies!

(But there is no one inside the bank)

Gang2: Fuck! It's a trap! We're fucked!

(All of sudden, a group of heavily-armed police bursts into the bank)

Police: Freeze! Give up your guns! And get down on the floor!

Gang2: Fuck you, you punk!

(He starts firing his gun. And police officers shoot him down)

Gang1: Hold your fire! I'm unarmed!

Police: Put your hands behind your head! And don't you ever try to move! I know what you're up to!

Gang1: (talking to himself) Shit! It's all over! This can't be happening!
	Somebody must've back-stabbed us! Otherwise.

(After gang1 is handcuffed. Gang2, who was shot to death, gets up on his feet)

Gang2: (to gang1) I'm sorry. I'm detective Lennon. I've been undercovering up to now to burst out your homeboys.

Gang1: I trusted you! How could you! You back-stabber!
